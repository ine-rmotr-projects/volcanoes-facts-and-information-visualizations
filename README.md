# Volcanoes facts and information visualizations

In this project, you will be practice how to create visualizations using a dataset from the [Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program (GVP)](https://volcano.si.edu/) which contains information and features of more than 1,500 volcanoes with eruptions during the Holocene period (approximately the last 10,000 years).

Start with the Notebook `Project.ipynb`, and best of luck!
